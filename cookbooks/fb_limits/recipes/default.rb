# We want to manage all limits config via /etc/security/limits.conf, so clean
# out limits.d/*.conf. Instead of deleting the directory, just overwrite the
# files with a comment indicating they were disabled by Chef. This is important
# so that upgrading or reinstalling an RPM that ships one such config file will
# not end up creating the file back again.
